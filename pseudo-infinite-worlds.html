  <h2> Introduction </h2>

  <p> Creating a truly infinite virtual terrain is an inachievable task 
    with today's and most likely any future hardware. Many approaches 
    simply mimic the infiniteness by having a terrain of a huge size, 
    sometimes too large to fully explore in hundreds of years. Others 
    present ways of making neverending terrains, but none completely 
    eliminate statistical homogeneity. The fundamental problem is rather 
    simple - computer memory is finite.
