      I'm Sasha, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Leeds. I enjoy messing around with C, C++ and sometimes other languages.
      Areas of my interest include computer graphics, physical simulations, operating systems, low-level programming and high-performance application development.
      <br><br>
      Whenever I'm not programming, I'm most likely playing music, gaming, drawing, reading Stephen King or trying to come up with new things to implement in code.
