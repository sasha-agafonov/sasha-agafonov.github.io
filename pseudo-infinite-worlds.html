      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Creating a truly infinite virtual terrain is an inachievable task 
      with today's and most likely any future hardware. Many approaches 
      simply mimic the infiniteness by having a terrain of a huge size, 
      sometimes too large to fully explore in hundreds of years. Others 
      present ways of making neverending terrains, but none completely 
      eliminate statistical homogeneity. The fundamental problem is rather 
      simple - computer memory is finite. </p>
