  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  
  <p> This is my very first OpenGL project. I really wanted to apply some motion physics, 
    and in fact I settled on the idea of creating an animated cloud trail
    even before I decided to make an airplane. I did consider other possibilities 
    for the aircraft, such as hot air balloon
    ships, but in the end, I decided that I wonâ€™t be able to create a reasonably detailed 
    and recognisable ship within the
    given timeframe, primarily because of the complex shapes involved. 
    For this reason, I decided to go ahead with a
    biplane.

  <h2> Contrail </h2>

  <p>
    Implementing an animated contrail was probably the most challenging part of the project. 
    The main idea is that the contrail is represented with spherical particles that spawn 
    from the back of the plane. A particle spawns with some velocity, 
    otherwise the contrail would not look natural. We set the scalar value to a fraction of the plane's speed. 
    Additionally, each particle moves in the same direction as the plane when that particle was spawned. When 
    a particle is spawned, it begins to decrease in size before disappearing completely.
