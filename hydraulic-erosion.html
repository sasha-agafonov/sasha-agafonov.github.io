    <p> Purely fractal terrains can resemble natural mountainous landscapes reasonably well. 
      However, such terrains are visually and statistically homogeneous, and they often lack 
      complex natural landforms, including mountain ridges and valleys. One of the ways to 
      overcome this is to simulate real-world physical processes, such as weathering and erosion 
      in the virtual terrain.
