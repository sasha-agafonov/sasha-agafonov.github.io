    Hey there!
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm Sasha, a Computer Science graduate from the University of Leeds. I enjoy messing around with C, C++ and sometimes other languages.
    Areas of my interest include computer graphics, physical simulations, operating systems, low-level programming and high-performance application development.
    <br><br>
    Whenever I'm not programming, I'm probably playing music, gaming, drawing, reading Stephen King or trying to come up with new things to implement in code.

    <br><br>
    Thank you for taking time to read this.
